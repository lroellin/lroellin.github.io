This is another shot at my personal website. Since I want to do it 2016 style this time (instead of PHP by hand), this will be hosted on Github Pages.

If you remember my old website, [www.dreami.ch (Archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20140417210722/https://www.dreami.ch/), this shall be the new version of it. 
There were some apps on that old site, some of it were client-side JS, some server-side PHP. There will probably be less features on it since some apps should better be run on a backend, like searching through MAC vendor databases, but I'll see what I can do.

Current plans for now
* Embed Bootstrap
* Use my old domain
* Move over contents
* Move over apps and re-write where needed
