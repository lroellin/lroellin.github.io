    <h1>EEE 901 as a desktop replacement</h1>     
      <p>I had to use my EEE as a desktop replacement, because my desktop’s harddisk  crashed and the new one arrived today.<br />
        Then I came to the idea to write a little review, how far you can use an  EEE 901 as a desktop replacement. <br />
        <br />
        My EEE has the following specifications:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Intel Atom N270 1.6GHz</li>
        <li>Intel Onboard graphics</li>
        <li>1024MB RAM</li>
        <li>Realtek HD Audio onboard</li>
        <li>8+4GB SSD</li>
        <li><strong>16GB SD </strong></li>
        <li>8.9&quot; (1024*600)</li>
        <li><strong>Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope Netbook Remix       Interface</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that it was always plugged to the power supply. But it could  handle the load, I once plugged it out for short.<br />
        <br />
        I’ve plugged in the following devices to my EEE (without an additional USB-hub)</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Logitech Illuminated Keyboard (on the highest       illumination level)</li>
        <li>Razer DeathAdder</li>
        <li>External harddisk (with external power supply)</li>
        <li>Logitech X-530 as a stereo system</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br />
        I was surprised, I’m doing a one year work experience as an IT supporter and I  often heard, that a laptop and many USB devices don’t get along well. I was  insecure too because of the power load, because my former mobile phone has  needed too much power, so the EEE automatically turned off. I was not able to  start it again till I plugged the mobile phone out and the power supply in. <br />
        My LG KP500 didn’t make any problems, it wasn’t recognized at first, but  that’s a software bug. My SD cards have been recognized after a restart. <br />
        <br />
        I’ve used the following applications, which ran quite smoothly, only aMSN had a  little long to build up the windows.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Firefox 3.0 (3.5 will be released with Ubuntu       9.10)</li>
        <li>aMSN</li>
        <li>XChat</li>
        <li>Totem as an audio player</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’ve had no problems with these software, except aMSN changed my  standard image, but I solved this quickly.<br />
        <br />
        The  little screen was a little bit disturbing. I’ve bought  a 24&quot; Full HD screen, so I’m used to bigger screens. I wasn’t able to plug  it to another screen, (I’d have had a 19&quot; Dell), because I knew that it  isn’t powerfull enough. I plugged it to a 19&quot; with 1280*1024 some months  ago, which slowed all down very much, so I had to reset the X-server (the  interface between the hardware and the kernel to say it simply).<br />
        It was enough for 2 days, but it’s not good enough as a desktop replacement for  long term use.
