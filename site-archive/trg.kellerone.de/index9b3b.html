<h1>Asus VH242H(L)</h1>
<p>  As you might know, I like making graphics or watching  movies. Well, you can make graphics on a 19‚Äù TFT, it works well, but not great.  But when it comes to watching movies, again: It works, but could be better.<br>
  So I decided to buy a bigger one, I had enough money, so I decided to spend my  money on something good and I ended up on the Asus VH242H(L), which met my  requirements.<br>
  You might ask yourself, what the (L) means. I originally wanted to buy the  VH242H, but my local store didn't sell it anymore, and the other one only had the VH242HL. The screen is the same, the only difference between them is  height-adjustable stand, which is only mounted on the VH242HL. It didn't really  cost more for me, so I bought this one. I'm not using the height-adjust  feature, so all what I'm writing here can be adapted to the VH242H.<br>
<h2>  Unboxing and connecting</h2>
  I advise you to take someone with you when you unbox  it, because the screen is bigger than you expect it to and it's not that light.  Mounting the stand is easy, once you get how it's done: Lay the screen on your  table and put the stand under the part that comes from the screen. In the box  there's a little screw, just put it in the right hole and rotate it till it's  fixed.<br>
  One big advantages is, that you get all the cables you need, I haven't seen  many screens which have got a VGA, a DVI and a sound cable in the box, even a VGA/DVI-adapter. You only  have to buy a HDMI cable if you need one, but not all need it, so it's  understandable. The cables are not some kind of cheap gift, they are long enough  (about 1.5 meters) and I can't find any disadvantages with these ones.<br>
<h2>  Common</h2>
  I'm really happy with the screen. The colors are good  and I couldn't see any &quot;ghosting&quot;. It's just awesome to watch a movie in 1080p.  I can't make a good picture of it to compare, because I've got nothing to  compare and I don't own a good camera, but let me tell you, that you won't be  disappointed by this screen if you're watching movies or doing work. Some others  tell, that the screen is too dark for them in big viewing angles, but I don't share this opinion. I've  got it on a quite dark level (in the settings) and it's enough, more would  dazzle me.<br>
  The built-in speakers are just great, they are not overmodulated by metal or  other kinds of loud music. You can turn it to the whole volume on the screen  and on the other source (I tried it with my notebook) and it doesn't sound  cheap. The basses are not strong, but not that  kind of flat like some cheap 2W speakers
  <h2>  Build quality</h2>
  The quality of this screen is just perfect. I couldn't  find anything that looks cheap. If you like quality, you get it!<br>
<h2>  Usability</h2>
  It's really easy to use the screen, there are no  disadvantages with connecting new things. The connectors are not hidden behind  something, so you don't have to get angry while fingering some cable to the  connector.<br>
  The only bad thing about it are the buttons. When you're using the menu, it's a  gambling game to choose the right button. The labeling of the buttons is not  well-readable, so you have to guess which button is the right one. Also, when you're pressing the buttons, you have to hold the  screen. By the way, the power button is not disturbing, because there's only a  little blue light on the right side when it's turned on, not the whole button  is illuminated.<br>
<h2>  Conclusion</h2>
  I am really happy with the screen, that's all I can  say. There are no big disadvantages which you encounter in daily using. I  really recommend you to buy this one, it's a good deal!</p>
