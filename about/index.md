## Website
This website runs on top of Github Pages. This is the third iteration on a personal website. I think the only thing that stayed the same was my focus on "Usability first".

So far I've had the following:

### 2008-2009: dreami.kellerone.de
The first iteration was hosted on a friend's vServer and I was pretty content with it. It was hand-coded HTML in Notepad and then processed by PHP for some include stuff like menus. If I find the time, I'll upload that one to here.
It was pretty shitty but I loved it at the time. I could finally show all my achievements to the world ;)

*Infrastructure:*

* Notepad, FileZilla

* Some vServer hosting, should be LAMP

*Lessons learned:*

* PHP include is not THAT cool

* Coding in Notepad is hard

* Most people are not impressed by nerdy websites

#### 2009: The Review Geek trg.kellerone.de
Based on my new knowledge of PHP I built a site dedicated to reviews. It wasn't that successful, judging from the number of reviews (3, in total) and the name was stolen from the Angry Video Game Nerd ;)

It was pretty fun though because I could learn from old mistakes. For the fun of it, here's an [archived, fully working copy](/site-archive/trg.kellerone.de/)

### 2013-2015 www.dreami.ch #1
This site was built after having had a PHP course. I already knew at that time that PHP was pretty shitty but I didn't want to learn Rails yet. It was pretty good but I soon hit the limitations of pure PHP and it was too late to switch it to a proper framework. I already had custom functions for everything (I'll post that too maybe).

*Infrastructure:*

* Notepad++, FTP plugin (yeah, really)

* Hetzner vServer hosting

* Apache, PHP, MySQL (classic LAMP)

*What I liked:*

* Focus on usability

* Wrote my own user-authentication module (actually secure)

*Lessons learned:*

* PHP *is* shitty

* Don't try to over-generalize everything you need into functions

* This was not 2015 style

#### 2013: [blog.dreami.ch](https://blog.dreami.ch)
My WordPress blog. Now hosted on WordPress's own site so I don't have to care about it anymore. I quite like the current state and it's a good way to get content out to people since it integrates quite well into FB and Twitter.

### 2016 www.dreami.ch #2
After having dumped my PHP site because I was not maintaining it anymore, I didn't think of having one anymore. I already started my site project, the blog, and that was running pretty fine. There still were some links around to my actual website and I thought, let's give it a try.

I wanted to do this in a modern style, so I got current tools and did it the proper way. I did reuse some stuff though, like the online tools I wrote (only reused the idea though) and I still like Bootstrap. I went for Material Design this time though.

The only thing I gave up is an actual backend. I have to prepare everything or let the client do it, so I gotta think of other ways to do things sometimes. But I got around that pretty soon and I actually like the clear distinction better

*Infrastructure*:

* Ubuntu VM on client

* Atom

* Github Pages and Github in general

* Jekyll, asset deployment tools like bundler and bower

*Lessons learned:*

* You don't need a backend for most things

* I *think* I now have the right platform for my future projects

## Me
This section won't list much current stuff since it'll only get outdated. A few things about me:

* Born in Summer of '93

* I've always liked music of a great variety

* I like discussing things with people but I may take some time until we can talk openly

I think the best source for current information about me is [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-r√∂llin-68a070a0).
